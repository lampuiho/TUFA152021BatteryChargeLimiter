Official ASUS service for Windows unneccessarily loops device control io in the background. You should only need to send the control once when the computer starts and when you wake up the laptop. There is no wake up event, so you need to use workstation unlock for the trigger. Use Windows Task Scheduler to import the xml to run at startup/unlocking workstation. Remember to change the path to the exe. To disable the threshold, simply restart the computer with the task disabled.
